# TIC-TAC-TOE

This is a simple game of tic-tac-toe that we all are familiar with.
In this the player plays against the computer which choose its moves at random _(making it very easy to win_)

The only module that the program requires is the random module.

## How to play

We start off by first creating a board which uses numbers 1-9 in order to mark the position like this-

```
-----------
   |   |
 1 | 2 | 3
   |   |
-----------
   |   |
 4 | 5 | 6
   |   |
-----------
   |   |
 7 | 8 | 9
   |   |
-----------
```

- The player can choose the marker it wants , X or 0. the computer chooses the opposite.

- The one who goes first is decided via a coinflip
  number of wins of both the player and computer are kept track of

- The game can be terminated mid way as well
