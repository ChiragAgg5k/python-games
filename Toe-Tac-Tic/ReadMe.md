This is a simple game of tic-tac-toe that we all are familiar with.
In this the player plays against the computer which choose its moves at random (making it very easy to win)

the only module that the program requires is the random module.

we start off by first creating a board which uses numbers 1-9 in order to mark the position like this-

-----------
   |   |
 1 | 2 | 3
   |   |
-----------
   |   |
 4 | 5 | 6
   |   |
-----------
   |   |
 7 | 8 | 9
   |   |
-----------

the player can choose the marker it wants , X or 0. the computer chooses the opposite
the one who goes first is decided via a coinflip
number of wins of both the player and computer are kept track of
the game can be terminated mid way as well

I hope to see useful suggestions and input by the community about this project.
