# HangMan

Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.
Here the computer is the one that thinks of a word at random.
You need to guess all the letters of the word in **7** or less number of tries
